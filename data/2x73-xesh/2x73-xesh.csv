I have submitted multiple request well over a year now and I appreciate the attempts to repair but they are not holding.  Most recently the damage to the road caused a main water break.  The heavy loads continue to cause major depressions in the road along the S curve and now extend in multiple places along Runyan road all the way out to Signal Mountain Blvd.  Drivers are being forced to cross the center line around the blind S curve to avoid the damage which is becoming a major safety concern especially when you consider this is a school bus route.  I strongly hope the builder when filing for the work they are doing had to pay a road impact fee to help pay for the damage.  Trucks have taken down the power line, stuck a power pole,  run over road sings...twice...broke a main water line and have done extensive damage to the roads around the site over the last couple years.  Additionally, while I can't confirm without entering the property, it appears that the excavating has come close to if not entered the power line 75ft easement.
